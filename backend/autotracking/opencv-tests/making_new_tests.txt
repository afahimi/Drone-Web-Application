If you want to make a new test video, simply get the video (example: yourvideo.avi) you want to extract frames from.

Then, using ffmpeg, you can extract frames like so:

(note: 1/1 indicates 1 frame every 1 second. for 10 frames every second, it would be 10/1)
$ ffmpeg -i yourvideo.avi -r 1/1 $filename%03d.jpg

Done!
